      <h1>Social Media</h1>

      <p>
        Social media is a digital platform that allows people to communicate,
        share ideas, and connect with others online. Popular platforms include
        Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and X.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest advantages of social media is connection. It allows
        people to stay in touch with friends and family, build communities, and
        share experiences instantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, social media can also have negative effects. Excessive use can
        impact mental health, reduce productivity, and spread misinformation if
        users are not careful.
